Game Space Inviders - laboratory work by Julia Suschik

A game based on Space invaders in the shooter genre. The control is carried out by means of the D / S / E keys, respectively, for moving to the right / left and shooting. The goal of the game is to win a certain number of levels, that is, to kill all the monsters on each level and not die yourself. Random monsters shoot at regular intervals, which decrease with each level. Also, at certain intervals, monstrs move down the screen. An enemy dies if it is hit by a certain number of player shots. The player dies if he has no health left (he has been hit by a certain number of enemy shots) or if the enemies have reached the bottom of the screen.
There is also a menu where the ability to select a level and a level editor is planned.
