Game Space Inviders - laboratory work by Julia Suschik

A game based on Space invaders in the shooter genre. The control is carried out by Right / Left / Space keys, respectively, for moving to the right / left and shooting. The goal of the game is to win a certain number of levels, that is, to kill all the monsters on each level and not die yourself. Random monsters shoot at regular intervals, which decrease with each level. In hard levels, when there are boss-monstrs, monstrs try to shoot exactly on you. Also, at certain intervals, monstrs move down the screen. An enemy dies if it is hit by a certain number of player shots. The player dies if he has no health left (he has been hit by three enemy shots) or if the enemies have reached the bottom of the screen.
There is also a menu where there is the ability to select a level and a level editor. 
User can make level themself. There is a level editor where they can choose the interval of shooting, moving and the disposition of monstrs.
